## Prediction markets are coming to Cheeze Wizards!

During the final phase of the Cheeze Wizards tournament, COI will be releasing prediction markets on Augur. These markets allow you to place bets of ETH on outcomes of the next dueling window! For example, you'll be able to bet on whether the power of a specific wizard will increase or if they'll be molded!

"Okay, but what's Augur?"

Augur is a decentralized protocol that allows for peer to peer decentralized prediction markets. The Protocol was created by the Forecast Foundation, but they do not actually manage markets, hold funds, or facilitate trades on the network. Instead, users of the Augur Protocol don‚Äôt make transaction requests to the Forecast Foundation, they transact themselves, directly and peer to peer, over the Ethereum network.

"That's cool, what does it really do?"

So glad you asked üòÇ Augur allows you trade across prediction markets. Meaning that speculators place bets on the outcome of future events. They seek to harness the ‚Äúwisdom of the crowd,‚Äù by aggregating information on a certain event. Aggregated crowd wisdom is a surprisingly effective way to make estimates and predictions and incentivizes participants to contribute their knowledge to the collective pool of wisdom by rewarding correct predictions.

## Enter the Cheeze Markets!

At COI we're carefully watching the mold and waiting for the best time to launch our first prediction market. Launching markets for our users to trade in is a fairly serious endeavour, because it will lock up at least 1 ETH of our funds while the community waits for the market to resolve.
