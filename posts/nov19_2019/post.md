## Prediction markets are coming to Cheeze Wizards!

During the final phase of the Cheeze Wizards tournament, COI will be releasing prediction markets on Augur. These markets allow you to place bets of ETH on outcomes of the next dueling window! For example, you'll be able to bet on whether the power of a specific wizard will increase or if they'll be molded!

"Okay, but what's Augur?"

Augur is a decentralized protocol that allows for peer-to-peer decentralized prediction markets. The Protocol was created by the Forecast Foundation, but they do not actually manage markets, hold funds, or facilitate trades on the network. Instead, users of the Augur Protocol don‚Äôt make transaction requests to the Forecast Foundation, they transact themselves, directly and peer to peer, over the Ethereum network.

"That's cool, what does it really do?"

So glad you asked üòÇ Augur allows you trade across prediction markets. Meaning that speculators place bets on the outcome of future events. They seek to harness the ‚Äúwisdom of the crowd,‚Äù by aggregating information on a certain event. Aggregated crowd wisdom is a surprisingly effective way to make estimates and predictions and incentivizes participants to contribute their knowledge to the collective pool of wisdom by rewarding correct predictions.

## Enter the Cheeze Markets!

We're watching the mold carefully, anxiously awaiting the best time to launch our first market ‚è∞ Because it will lock up at least 1 ETH of our funds (while waiting for market the resolution), we want to be careful not to launch our markets too early.

# Breaking it down like mold

Trading across peer-to-peer requires liquidity and mold growth is exponential, so we shouldn't tie up funds in ill liquid markets that benefit nobody. Here's a few things we believe could lead to the creation of ill liquid or less exciting markets:

1. Wizard is not at risk of being consumed by mold
2. Owner has other Wizards they can transfer power to 
3. Not enough Wizards removed from the tournament 

In case #1 there is no requirement for the Wizard to actually duel which incentivizes shorting the market, since the market is hedged in favour of the Wizard doing nothing. Something similar is happening in case #2 as well. In some cases, it makes more sense for a user to dodge the mold increase by consolidating some of their power. It's not guaranteed to happen but does hedge heavily in favour of shorting the market. 

In case, #3, it becomes a question of how well our markets will perform in a situation where most people haven't yet lost their stake in the tournament. We really see our prediction markets as a way to win back some of the money you've lost after being removed from the tournament completely, and as a way to remain invested in following the final developments of the Big Cheeze üßÄ
