# Prediction markets are coming to Cheeze Wizards!

During the final phase of the Cheeze Wizards tournament, COI will be releasing prediction markets on Augur. These markets allow you to place bets of ETH on outcomes of the next dueling window! For example, you'll be able to bet on whether the power of a specific wizard will increase or if they'll be molded!

## "Okay, but what's Augur?"

Augur is a decentralized protocol that allows for peer-to-peer decentralized prediction markets. The Protocol was created by the Forecast Foundation, but they do not actually manage markets, hold funds, or facilitate trades on the network. Instead, users of the Augur Protocol don’t make transaction requests to the Forecast Foundation, they transact themselves, directly and peer to peer, over the Ethereum network.

## "That's cool, what does it really do?"

So glad you asked 😂 Augur allows you trade across prediction markets. Meaning that speculators place bets on the outcome of future events. They seek to harness the “wisdom of the crowd,” by aggregating information on a certain event. Aggregated crowd wisdom is a surprisingly effective way to make estimates and predictions and incentivizes participants to contribute their knowledge to the collective pool of wisdom by rewarding correct predictions.

## Enter the Cheeze Markets!

We're watching the mold carefully, anxiously awaiting the best time to launch our first market ⏰ Because it will lock up at least 1 ETH of our funds (while waiting for market the resolution), we want to be careful not to launch our markets too early.

## Breaking it down like mold

Trading across peer-to-peer requires liquidity and mold growth is exponential, so we shouldn't tie up funds in ill liquid markets that benefit nobody. Here's a few things we believe could lead to the creation of ill liquid or less exciting markets:

1. Wizard is not at risk of being consumed by mold
2. Owner has other Wizards they can transfer power to 
3. Not enough Wizards removed from the tournament 

In case #1 there is no requirement for the Wizard to actually duel which incentivizes shorting the market, since the market is hedged in favour of the Wizard doing nothing. Something similar is happening in case #2 as well. In some cases, it makes more sense for a user to dodge the mold increase by consolidating some of their power. It's not guaranteed to happen but does hedge heavily in favour of shorting the market. 

In case, #3, it becomes a question of how well our markets will perform in a situation where most people haven't yet lost their stake in the tournament. We see our prediction markets as a way to win back some of the money you've lost after being removed from the tournament completely. But also a way to remain invested in following the final developments of the Big Cheeze 🧀!

# Enter the Duelists!

As of the most recent fight window over 8000 duels have been completed on Cheeze Wizards, so cool! We're expecting around 2000 Mold Power to be an interesting time to launch our first markets. In the meantime, we're been watching 👀 the top duelists closely.

 To create a bit of fight hype 🤼🥊 we reached out to our favourite duelists and asked them, cheeze willing, to shed a insight on strategy and their approach to dueling.

(We spoke with TEN1000🍰🧀 as well, but it was extemely difficult to get 10k to talk any trash! Obviously, a consummate gentleperson and our vote for most sportsmanlike player in the game!)



# Q: Are turn randomizers currently on your radar? Are they a determining factor right now, and what about long term?


🧀Entr0py🍰:
> Haha ya actually! I lost 2k power versus someone who claims they used a randomizer 😠 Randomizers benefit whales who can afford to take multiple losses and keep challenging you. If you whalin' out just roll dat dice till you gain yer power back. Less and less impact long term though, cause you can only roll the dice when you can afford a losing streak :)


nevverlander: 
> Nope and nope


TheRealDW:
> Yes eventually people are going to figure out a pattern to how you think if you play them enough and it's a long tournament. Its worth lower odds imo.


Hrmm could it be that summoners overestimated the impact randomizers would have on the tournament? Very interesting indeed. TEN1000🍰🧀 also mentioned to us an interesting idea: maybe the best form of randomness in Cheeze Wizards is manually selected to suit the given situation.


# Q: Any opinion on baiting (casting one way for a while then switching to the opposite to catch your opponent off guard)?


🧀Entr0py🍰: 
> Grinding up ELO takes long, but falling or losing everything happens in a heartbeat. So why risk baiting? 
> The idea is you intentionally lose power over several matches then win it all back (and then some) in a single duel that's flawlessly executed. Sounds risky right? Except it's not, cause people can split their wizards across 2 or more accounts to bait duels against theirself without actually losing power. Notice how this strat simultaneously creates baits on 2 accounts both under your control. Like damn dawg.
> Also, not much difference between "baiting" and "adjusting your strategy" after you fell into a pattern AMIRITE?

_Note: at this point of the conversation 🧀Entr0py🍰 dropped a "10 hours of Nyan Cat" video meme and we have no idea whether or not it's related to the above discussion LOL_


nevverlander: 
> That works well if you have a lot of wizards to spare or you are dueling with low powered wizards. It won't work in any other case


TheRealDW:
> Is there a point to baiting if you are going to risk a lot more losses to just set up the pattern? Then you have one chance to change your pattern, but what if the opponent doesn't take it?


# Q: Are you careful about selecting challenges, or is anyone fair game?


This was an interesting question, or not? depending on where your headspace is at regarding the current dueling meta. 🧀Entr0py🍰 was a bit coy but, reading between the lines, it seemed like all 3 duelists generally agreed that duels should be selected carefully but also that you should duel against a diverse array of players to remain sharp!


🧀Entr0py🍰:
> You messin' with the champ, of course anyone is fair game!  If I declined your challenge consider it the biggest compliment you can receive in Cheeze Wizards. Sure, I could duel nevverlander or TheRealDickWang now. I might learn about their strategy, but they'll learn something about my strategy. I rather face them in the late game.

nevverlander:
> I am more careful and strategic now compared to the initial phases of the tournament. I try to play as many different players as possible


TheRealDW:
> There's a short list of people who I've lost to a few times. I won't go back to the well unless I have to later in the tournament.


# Wrapping it up in wax

Finally, we gave each summoner a unique question designed just for them. For 🧀Entr0py🍰 we asked "Anything else you want to say to the "fans" who voted for you on Strawpoll?" to which they simply replied "Nah." and promptly left the chat 
😂


# Q (nevverlander): You like to duel yourself huh? Is that a strategy?

nevverlander:
> Just my attempts to redistribute power amongst my wizards. Now I know about the COI simulation, you won't see too many self duels from me.

Excellent point here from nevverlander! Haven't played a duel simulation yet? Here's an interesting one you can try: https://cheezeofinsight.com/duels/?wiz1=6140&wiz2=6842 That's one of 🧀Entr0py🍰's Neutral Wizards vs. one of TEN1000🍰🧀's Neutrals.


# Q (TheRealDW): Impressive how you sold most of your power then quickly dueled your way back to the top! But what value does buying power provide if someone can remain competitive after losing their power and just grinding?


TheRealDW:
> Power is fickle. It takes a lot of wins to build up but is easy to lose in just one loss. Also important is your time. Many people are dueling for maybe 30 power realistically if they are just fighting 70 Power wizards. That's like five bucks that you are playing for. In exchange for a few bucks you are spending time grinding while revealing your strategy. Buying power is buying peace of mind, to avoid facing the blue mold for a while, and a strategic advantage. You really get time to study how everyone else reacts before making a move. 

> Being a high powered wizard was nice because you could bully smaller wizards. They need to win two duels just to gain any power sometimes which helps the odds. Also, you can make much more in each Duel playing for higher stakes.


# GL EVERYONE, & SEE YOU IN THE FIGHT WINDOW!
